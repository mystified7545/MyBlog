About myself:

- In recent years I had been trying to find out a way to involve myself to make social contribution towards consulting about IT. 
In between all brainstorming, in recent months I joined a software company as a project manager. I had beening handle wordpres projects
for quite sometime and which is basically gave me a idea that creating a  blog would probably be a effective way to spread IT idea. 

-Now It has been few months since which blog a getting it some shape. I am certain struggling and a lack of domain expertise would certain a go a long way till
a finish line. Many of you would have a definite suggestion on the site and i am expect and believe whould be a boost for me to correct and improve
